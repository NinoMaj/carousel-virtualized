# Carousel-virtualized (in active development)
Highly performant react carousel built with virtualization (thanks to [react-window](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window "react-window github page"))

# Motivation
After trying most of carousels out there, we couldn't find one that would allow us to load large number of slide (e.g. >10k) and had all the features that one carousel needs.

# Features
...

# Todo
[ ] utilize render prop  
[ ] add animation  
[ ] add documentation  
[ ] make demos on codesandbox  
[ ] add variable items in carousel  
[ ] tests  
[ ] a11y  

Discuss before implementation:
[ ] wrapAround - we probably need this  
[ ] autoplay - should we support this  
[ ] dots  - should we support this  
[ ] outerTagName and innerTagName, now is always div  
[ ] lockOnWindowScroll and documentScroll - do we need this  

# Done
[x] auto container sizer  
[x] mouse, touch and keyboard navigation (improvements needed)  
[x] auto resizer 
[x] convert to typescript 
[x] build/bundling
